# Power Calculator
This is a Vuejs component to help decide how long you should run your experiment.

# External Dependencies
Currently the graph works with D3 and C3. You will have to add those libraries to your project in case you want the graph.

# Getting Started
## Instalation
To build the files you will need [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).

Then you can run ```$ npm install```.

When you want to build the component you will use ```$ rollup -c```.

When you want to develop, rollup has a watch flag, use ```$ rollup -c -w```.

You can change rollup.config.js if the current setup doesn't suit your needs.

We are creating a js and css output files. You need to add both to your project.

## How to use:
After running rollup, you will have a vuejs component you can add to your vuejs application.

Simple example would be:
```js
let { powerCalculator, store } = require('powercalculator');

const storeInstance = new Vuex.Store(store)

new Vue(Object.assign({
    store: storeInstance,
    el: '.power-calculator',
}, powerCalculator));
```

Please note that the module will actually have 2 different properties:
 - component
 - store

In the example above we are just using the component to create a vue instance. It could be used with `Vue.component` as well.

You can create the instace of vuex with the store, merge it with yours.

## Some of the important actions of powercalculator store
| action | description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| init:calculator | Called when the component is mounted. starts calculations and deal with needed logic |
| field:change | Most important action. Dispatched whenever an input field change. This is the root of all the logic behind most of the mutations will happen. |
| update:proptocalculate | Triggers the calculation of the highlighted block |

# Dev Server
There is no dev server. You can play with the github pages as they point to the dist folder.

You can open the index.html directly or use something such as `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080` to use localhost:8080.

# Tests
Due to the complexity of the tool we have a few different options of testing.

 - `npm run test`: Run all tests - test the mathematical functions, runs eslint and test the store updates
 - `npm run vue-check`: runs eslint and test the store updates (we are unlikely to change the mathematical functions as often as the rest)
 - `npm run store`: test the store updates
 - `npm run eslint`: runs eslint
